I am interested in applying economic theory and empirical methods to understand the intersection of government policy, market structure, firm conduct, and consumer welfare, particularly in the food and agricultural sectors.\n\n\nJob Market Paper\nMy job market paper studies the vertical relationships in the U.S. infant formula market under the WIC program and its rebate system, and aims to answer:  How are infant formula prices set, and what are the implications of this pricing structure for the distribution of surplus across manufacturers, retailers, consumers, and the government? \nYou can read the full paper here.\n\n\nEducation\n\nPurdue University | PhD in Agricultural Economics | 2026 (Expected)\n\nUC Davis | MS in Agricultural and Resource Economics | 2020\nChina Three Gorges University | M.S. in Technology Economics and Management | 2019\nChina Three Gorges University | B.M.S. in Logistics Management | 2016\n\n\n\nTeaching\n\nAGEC 516 – Fall 2024\n\nPh.D. Math Camp – Summer 2024"

Sessions on building community and classroom engagement helped shape my teaching philosophy and informed my approach to designing and teaching my first master’s-level course, which received positive student feedback and led to my nomination for Purdue’s College of Agriculture Graduate Student Excellence in Teaching Award. The workshop also enriched my teaching “knowledge tank”—a growing foundation of strategies and insights I continually draw from as I evolve in my teaching journey.\n\n\n\nProfessional Development through Teaching Academy Webinars, September 2024 - May 2025\n\nSince September 2024, I have actively participated in monthly Teaching Academy webinars, which continue to enrich my teaching practices. I’ve provided the opportunity to explore strategies to make classrooms more welcoming and interactive, including the use of LTIs and a case-study approach to connect theory with real-world problems. Each session adds to the toolkit I draw from to support my overarching goal: helping students become confident, engaged, and application-oriented agricultural economists.\n\n\n\nPractical Applications of Generative AI in Teaching and Learning, Purdue University Online Workshops, Fall 2024\n\nThis workshop series shifted my perspective on AI in the classroom—from concern to curiosity and integration. I learned practical strategies for using generative AI to enhance student engagement, accessibility, and instructional efficiency. I now view AI as an add-on that, when used thoughtfully, can enrich the overall learning experience."

I do this by building a classroom environment where students feel seen, heard, and respected. I design clear, flexible materials to make challenging content accessible, and I regularly seek feedback to adjust my teaching in real time. I hold high expectations while providing consistent support, so students are both challenged and encouraged. Through reflection, responsiveness, and care, I meet students where they are and help them move forward."

    "text": "Abstract: The US Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) provides free infant formula to low-income households, serving around 39% of US infants and accounting for over half of all domestically sold formula—making it a substantial government expenditure. To reduce government costs, WIC awards exclusive contracts to manufacturers offering the lowest net price in each state and collects rebates from the winning bidders via public auction, effectively creating governmentsanctioned monopolies in the WIC market. The broader implications of this policy hinge on vertical relationships between manufacturers and retailers, which remain poorly understood. I identify the vertical relationship as best characterized by twopart tariffs, where retailers pay fixed fees to manufacturers and wholesale markups are zero. Counterfactual analyses show that, when pricing control shifts to manufacturers, average retail prices increase by 3.79%, producer surplus rises by 2.17%, and consumer surplus declines by 7.44%. I also observe heterogeneous price responses for WIC auction winners and losers. Notably, winners generally raise prices when granted retail pricing power. These findings underscore the importance of firm conduct in shaping program efficacy and market outcomes.\nPoster presentation at the 2025 AAEA Annual Meeting\nRead the full paper here"
