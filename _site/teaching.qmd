My primary teaching goal is to empower students to think critically, apply knowledge with confidence, and take ownership of their learning journey. I aim to make my teaching materials accessible, relevant, and engaging.  Ultimately, I want my students to leave the classroom not only with stronger technical skills but also with greater confidence in their ability to learn, solve real-world problems, and grow as independent thinkers and economists.
