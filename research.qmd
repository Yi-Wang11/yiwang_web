#### **Testing Vertical Relationships in the US Infant Formula Market: Implications for Government Costs and Welfare**

<div class="justified-abstract">
- **Abstract:** The US Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
(WIC) provides free infant formula to low-income households, serving around 39% of
US infants and accounting for over half of all domestically sold formula—making it a
substantial government expenditure. To reduce government costs, WIC awards exclusive contracts to manufacturers offering the lowest net price in each state and collects
rebates from the winning bidders via public auction, effectively creating governmentsanctioned monopolies in the WIC market. The broader implications of this policy hinge on vertical relationships between manufacturers and retailers, which remain
poorly understood. I identify the vertical relationship as best characterized by twopart tariffs, where retailers pay fixed fees to manufacturers and wholesale markups
are zero. Counterfactual analyses show that, when pricing control shifts to manufacturers, average retail prices increase by 3.79%, producer surplus rises by 2.17%, and consumer surplus
declines by 7.44%. I also observe heterogeneous price responses for WIC auction
winners and losers. Notably, winners generally raise prices when granted retail pricing
power. These findings underscore the importance of firm conduct in shaping program
efficacy and market outcomes.
